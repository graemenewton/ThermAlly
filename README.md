# ThermAlly

The ThermAlly was borne out of the need for a thermal control system to stimulate receptive fields of nociceptors in the skin-nerve preperation for teased-fibre electrophysiology. Upon researching methods for this, I was shocked to find how expensive they were - especially if you wanted to perform cold stimulation! I refused to pay £1000s for a refrigerated and heated circulating water baths, and I began researching how I could solve this myself. I present the ThermAlly, a bidirectional thermal stimulator which can be built for under £100.

It is driven by an Arduino Due and functions by taking pre-chilled fluid and tightly regulating temperature in a feedback-controlled loop. It works via an 'always on' confuguration, thereby heating fluid to your desired baseline temeprature and either tuning off the heating element to cool, or increasing the power supplied to the heating element to heat the perfusate.

Details of how to build this device will be available upon its public release, although please contact Graeme Newton (graeme.newton@bristol.ac.uk) with any questions. Currently, this is in the early development alpha phase. I hope to work on this in the coming year to bring it to the stage where researchers can order a pre-designed PCB from a supplier, order a pre-designed laser-cut case from a supplier, and order all the components they need to build it themselves - making this device truly, open-source.
